// Item 8 — self-reported referral attribution.
//
// WHY SELF-REPORTED AT ALL
//
// F-Droid has no install-referrer mechanism. Play Store has the Install
// Referrer API; F-Droid has structurally nothing equivalent, and no UTM
// scheme or redirect trick closes the gap — the chain breaks the moment
// someone leaves the site to install. Vercel Analytics sees the web side
// only. So the sole way to attribute an F-Droid install back to a specific
// post is for the user to say so.
//
// SHAPE
//
// Reuses the `limecore_origin` mechanism exactly: one namespaced key in the
// user's own auth metadata, written once, never overwritten. No table, no
// column, no migration — clean against P1, nothing for an old build in the
// wild to fail to understand.
//
// The suite wrinkle from originMarker.ts applies here too and is, unusually,
// a feature: the field lives on the shared auth user, so whichever suite app
// asks first records the answer and the other two see it already present and
// stay quiet. The user is asked once per account, not once per app.
