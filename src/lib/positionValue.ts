// v1.9 Item 14b — the one place a holding turns into a base-currency number.
//
// This maths existed in two places: `metricsFor()` in screens/finance/
// Portfolio.tsx and an inline loop in components/InsightsCard.tsx. They were
// byte-identical, which is the good case — the bad case is the day one gets a
// fix and the other doesn't, and the portfolio total silently disagrees with
// the insight that reads from it. In a screen full of money that is a
// correctness bug, not a tidiness one.
//
// Consolidated ahead of 14b's cash-flow diagram (#2) and the trended net-worth
// and budget-vs-actual views (#5, #6), all of which need the same conversion.
// The build plan's own note applies: build the aggregation once, render it
// several ways.
//
// Behaviour is deliberately UNCHANGED from both former copies:
//   - stock/etf: quote price x quantity, normalised out of the quote's
//     currency (Finnhub reports some venues in minor units — GBp, ZAc — which
//     `normalizeCurrency` folds to major), then converted to base.
//   - crypto:   CoinGecko prices in EUR, so it is EUR -> base, and the EUR
//     case short-circuits rather than round-tripping through a rate of 1.
//   - a missing quote returns null, NOT 0. "No price yet" and "worth nothing"
//     are different facts and callers rely on telling them apart.
