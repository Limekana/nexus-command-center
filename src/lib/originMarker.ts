// ACT-5 — where do the accounts actually come from?
//
// 103 accounts had arrived by 2026-07-26 against 52 lifetime APK downloads
// across all three repos, with no web build in existence and no F-Droid
// distribution during the surge. The leading hypothesis is that most of them
// are developers running a cloned repo against production: the Supabase URL
// and anon key have to resolve at build time for F-Droid's reproducible
// builds, so `git clone` + `npm run dev` yields a working client pointed at
// the real project.
//
// Until a client can be told apart from a dev server, that stays a
// hypothesis and every activation number is uninterpretable. This stamps one
// namespaced key into the user's own auth metadata so the three cases
// separate cleanly:
//
//   native Android build   -> native: true,  platform: 'android'
//   dev server / clone     -> native: false, platform: 'web', origin has :5173
//   future web build       -> native: false, platform: 'web', origin limecore.dev
//
// Written once and never overwritten, so it records where an account was
// FIRST seen by an instrumented build — not necessarily where it signed up.
// The 103 existing accounts predate this, so they only acquire a marker if
// they ever come back, which is itself a signal worth having.

/**
 * Stamp the origin marker onto the signed-in user, once, ever.

 * Safe to call on every auth event: the marker rides along in the session's
 * user_metadata, so the already-stamped case costs one property read and no
 * network call. updateUser() fires USER_UPDATED, which re-enters the caller's
 * auth listener — by then the metadata is present, so it terminates.
 *
 * Fire-and-forget by design. Instrumentation is not worth delaying or failing
 * a sign-in over, so this returns void and swallows its own errors.
