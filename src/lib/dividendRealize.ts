// Dividend auto-realize — v1.7 (BUG-2).
//
// Problem: the Portfolio screen shows projected dividend income and each
// holding's next ex-div date, but when a dividend's pay date actually passes
// the event simply drops out of the "upcoming" list — nothing ever credits the
// portfolio cash balance. Projected income silently vanishes instead of
// becoming realized cash.
//
// Fix: on every portfolio refresh, reconcile each holding's dividend events
// against the cash ledger. Any dividend whose realize date (pay date, or the
// ex-div date as a fallback when the provider omits pay date) has arrived and
// that isn't already in the ledger produces a `dividend` cash entry crediting
// perShare × quantity in the dividend's native currency.
//
// Determinism + idempotency: the entry id is derived deterministically from
// the natural key `div:<TICKER>:<exDivDate>` via legacyIdToUuid. That means:
//   - re-running the reconcile never double-credits (same id already present),
//   - the id survives a cloud round-trip unchanged (it IS the row PK — a valid
//     UUID, so legacyIdToUuid is identity on it), and
//   - two devices independently computing the same credit produce the same id,
//     so the cloud upsert collapses them instead of creating duplicates.
// (A string relatedId would be hashed on push and NOT round-trip, so id — the
// PK — is the only reliable dedupe key here.)
//
// Anchor: on first run we stamp today's date in localStorage and only realize
// dividends whose realize date is >= that anchor. Providers return the trailing
// ~12 months of dividends, so without the anchor an upgrade would dump a lump
// of historical dividends into cash on the first refresh. Going forward, each
// dividend is realized once, as its date arrives.
//
// Known simplification (acceptable for a personal tool, noted for honesty): we
// credit the holding's CURRENT quantity, not the quantity held on the ex-div
// date. If shares were bought/sold between ex-div and now the credited amount
// can be slightly off. The ledger is append-only and every entry carries a
// descriptive note, so a manual `adjust` can correct any edge case.
