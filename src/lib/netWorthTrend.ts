// v1.9 Item 14b #5 — net worth, properly trended.
//
// The Account model has existed since v1.2 but never got a time-series view.
// It does not need one added to the schema: a balance is `startingBalance` plus
// the signed sum of every transaction touching the account, so a balance AS OF
// any past date is the same sum truncated at that date. Replaying is exact, not
// an estimate, and it needs no new table and no backfill.
//
// Reuses `computeAccountBalance` rather than reimplementing the sum. That
// helper already handles transfer direction, liability sign conventions and
// cross-currency conversion; a second copy of that arithmetic in a screen full
// of money is the FX-consolidation mistake all over again.
//
// THREE THINGS THIS DELIBERATELY REFUSES TO INVENT
//
// 1. An account contributes only from its own `createdAt` forward. A savings
//    account added in July held money in March in real life, but the app has no
//    record of that and `startingBalance` carries no date. Back-dating it would
//    fabricate history. The step this creates at onboarding is real
//    information, so each point names the accounts that first appear in it and
//    the chart marks them — an explained step beats a smoothed lie.
// 2. Holdings history comes from `portfolioSnapshots`, which only exist from
//    the day the user first refreshed with priced holdings. Months before that
//    report `holdingsBase: null` — unknown, not zero — and the caller says so.
//    Portfolio CASH is different: the ledger is dated and append-only, so it
//    replays exactly like accounts do.
// 3. FX is converted at TODAY's rates, because that is the only rate table the
//    app has. A past balance in another currency is therefore restated in
//    today's money rather than historically accurate. `usedFx` is set so the
//    caller can say that out loud instead of implying precision it lacks.
