// Suite SSO — mint an INDEPENDENT session for a sibling app.
//
// ── The bug this exists to kill ──────────────────────────────────────────
// NCC publishes its session bundle over a signed ContentProvider, and LimeLog
// and StudyDesk used to adopt it with `supabase.auth.setSession(...)`. That
// copies NCC's refresh_token, so all three apps end up holding the same token
// in the same rotation family. Supabase rotates a refresh_token on every use
// and treats a second presentation of an already-used token as theft: it
// revokes the ENTIRE family. Whichever app woke up second therefore signed all
// three out — the "logged out every day or two" report.
//
// The server-side evidence was unambiguous. On the owner's account, six
// sessions died in seventeen days, every one of them Android, every one with
// its whole token chain revoked and no successor issued, each death landing
// minutes after a *successful* rotation by a sibling — not after a long idle
// gap, which is what an expiry would look like. No desktop session ever died
// that way.
//
// ── The fix ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Stop sharing the token. The sibling proves who it is with NCC's access_token
// and gets back a one-time credential it can exchange for a session of its
// own, with its own independent refresh-token family. After that the three
// apps refresh on separate rotation chains and cannot revoke each other.
//
// Safety properties, in order of how badly they would go wrong if missing:
//
//   1. The user is taken from the caller's own JWT and never from the request
//      body. There is no parameter naming a user or an email, so this endpoint
//      cannot be aimed at somebody else's account no matter what is posted.
//   2. The JWT is verified by asking Auth to resolve it rather than by decoding
//      it here — a forged or expired token resolves to no user and is rejected.
//   3. Only `hashed_token` is returned, never the generated action link. The
//      link carries a redirect target and is the half of this that would be
//      useful in a phishing email; the bare hash is not.
//   4. This grants the caller nothing it did not already have. A caller who
//      reaches step 3 has already demonstrated a live session for that user.
//      The exchange converts one valid credential into another for the same
//      user — it is not a privilege boundary being crossed.
//
// Deploy:  supabase functions deploy suite-session
// Secrets: SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY are injected by the
//          platform; nothing needs to be set by hand.
