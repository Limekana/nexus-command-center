-- limecore#16 — the production "before" state 20260926_client_errors.sql is
-- written against, for a throwaway Postgres. Supabase's auth schema and API
-- roles are stubbed; every table purge_soft_deleted() touches exists with the
-- columns it reads. purge_soft_deleted() is created from the migration's own
-- copy with the client_errors block removed, which must reproduce
-- production's body exactly: the migration's md5 guard fails otherwise, so a
-- passing run is itself the proof that this fixture matches production.
--
-- Load order: this file, then the migration, then client_errors.test.sql.
